# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

## 1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems

## 2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include:
  1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran)
  2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
  3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
  4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

## 3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


## 4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
#### Waterfall Methodology

  1. Linear, Sequential Approach: Follows a rigid, step-by-step process, moving from one phase to the next in a linear fashion.   
  2. Phases: Typically includes requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment.

#### Agile Methodology

  1. Iterative, Incremental Approach: Breaks down the project into smaller, manageable iterations or sprints.   
  2. Flexibility: Adapts to changing requirements and priorities throughout the project lifecycle.

#### When to Use Each Methodology

#### Waterfall:

  1. Well-defined Requirements: Projects with clear, stable requirements that are unlikely to change.   
  2. Predictable Projects: Projects with a well-understood scope and timeline.

#### Agile:

  1. Uncertain Requirements: Projects with evolving requirements or where the final product is not fully defined upfront.
  2. Rapid Change: Projects in dynamic environments where quick responses to change are necessary.

## 5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

## 6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


## 7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
#### Strategies for Overcoming Challenges:
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


## 8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### 9. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

### 10. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Create for me a website

Good prompt: create an interactive school website with one webpage that contains a navbar(about, contact), header section, and the body section to consist of some images of the school and more information about it, make it colourful 

Importance : you'll get a more focused response.
